# musescore-low-whistle
This repo provides an extra instrument file for adding Low Whistle types to Musescore.

The Low Whistle, which is a metal 6 hole Flageolet, is larger than the more well-known tin
whistle and has a lower pitch. The low whistle is commonly available in three tunings:
* "D Low Whistle" tuned to D4, also used for keys Em and G
* "F Low Whistle" tuned to F4, also used for Gm and Bâ™­
* "G Low Whistle" tuned to G4, also used for Am and C

## Install
The file low-whistle.xml needs to be installed as an instrument extension using the MuseScore
menu. Use the same file for both MuseScore version 2.x and MuseScore version 3.x :

### MuseScore 2.x
1. copy file the low-whistle.xml file to Documents/MuseScore2/Extensions/low-whistle.xml
2. within Musescore menu navigate to: File -> Preferences... -> Scores tab
3. in the Default Files panel, add the file to 'Instrument List 2' extension by:
4. browsing to Documents/MuseScore2/Extensions/low-whistle.xml and add to 'Instrument List 2'

### MuseScore 3.x
1. copy file the low-whistle.xml file to Documents/MuseScore3/Extensions/low-whistle.xml
2. within Musescore menu navigate to: MuseScore -> Preferences... -> Score tab
3. in the Default Files panel, add the file to 'Instrument List 2' extension by:
4. browsing to Documents/MuseScore3/Extensions/low-whistle.xml and add to 'Instrument List 2'

MuseScore will now list more tin whistles types under 'World Music' 'Woodwinds'. Once the
low whistle staff is added to the score there is no need to keep this instrument
file in the 'Instrument List 2' extension.
